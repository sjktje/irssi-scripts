akill.pl		Makes adding AKILLs to OperServ easier

iplist.pl		Writes ips of channel members to file

kline.pl		Makes adding klines easy as pie.

lobby.pl		Issues /LOBBY on connecting clients (useless unless you oper on
				a Ambernet server running lobby.so)

lusergraph.pl   Grabs local/global user count from server and writes
				a mrtg-friendly file

qkill.pl		/qkill nick1,nick2,nick3 [reason]

rwho.pl			This script is not really working anymore and is only in the
				repository for historical reasons. It was used by me, sjk, on
				Undernet in 2006 or so to detect "real name clones". I don't 
				think this particular version of the script is actually working.

warnkick.pl		This script warns you if you get kicked from a channel. Prints
				a warning and hilights the channels refnum.

whocount.pl		Adds a total count to /who replies
